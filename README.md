## Overview

This package provides a comprehensive solution for eigenvalue problems associated with hydrodynamic stability systems.

## Structure

This package is designed based on the structure and fundamental concepts of [SciMLBase.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl), particularly in terms of the abstract types:

- Problem
- Algorithms
- Solution
- Function

Furthermore, the coding style adheres to the conventions established by SciML.
